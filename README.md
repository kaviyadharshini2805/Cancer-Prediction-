# Cancer-Prediction-
A machine learning–powered web application that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. Built with scikit-learn and Streamlit, this project includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model tuning, and an interactive UI for real-time predictions.
